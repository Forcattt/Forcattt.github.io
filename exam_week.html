	We'r having exam week at this moment, the last exam in the 11th grade.
	I am sure everyone has been studying a lot and preparing themself
	to face this exam. An unexpected news happened to hit us in this time
	as well, about the death of BAT. 

	But even so, we shall not get depressed and fail our test. We will 
	have to carry on, and do our best nevertheless. Let's do our best
	for the exam and make our class great again!!!.
